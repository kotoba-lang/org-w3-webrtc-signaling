;; `kotoba/rt/routing.kotoba` against `kotoba.rt.core/route-message`.
;;
;; The slice is the routing decision: who is allowed to send into a room,
;; who may be addressed, and which clients a broadcast reaches. The room
;; table, the sockets and every payload byte stay in the host.
;;
;; So the two are handed the same room and the same message and compared on
;; the deliveries and the reason for a refusal. The guest is handed no
;; payload at all -- the oracle's `:payload` is carried through the host and
;; never reaches it, which is the relay's whole promise.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph).
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;; Each is an access-control decision, and each passes on a relay that
;; simply looks up a room and fans out:
;;
;;   * `a-sender-not-in-the-room-cannot-signal-into-it` — anyone who can
;;     reach the relay can NAME any room; membership is what makes naming
;;     one different from being in it;
;;   * `an-addressed-recipient-must-be-in-the-room` — the room is the
;;     boundary and `:to` must not cross it;
;;   * `a-broadcast-does-not-echo-to-the-sender` — a relay that echoes makes
;;     every client answer its own offer;
;;   * `an-absent-room-is-not-an-empty-broadcast` — both produce an empty
;;     delivery list and they are not the same fact. One is "nobody to
;;     tell", the other is "no such call";
;;   * `a-truncated-member-list-is-refused` — a short broadcast looks
;;     exactly like a successful one.
